# Spark Tutorial

This repository is where I record my practice using Spark in Java 8 and Python. `spark-java` and `spark-python` are my implementation for [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-course-with-java/) examples and problems. In addtion, I practice data exploration and analytsis following the book, [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793). To get familiar with advanced **pythonic** usage, I also complete a subset of [Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Recipes-Mastering-ebook/dp/B00DQV4GGY).
